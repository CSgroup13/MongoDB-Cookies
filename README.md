This script is building a database for a cookie store using MongoDB, defining three collections: 
"cookies," "customers," and "orders."

The database design incorporates a combination of Embedded and Referenced data modeling to optimize system performance.
By using Embedded, we allow saving data that is not required for direct external access together with the main document,
which can reduce the database access load and improve system performance.
On the other hand, by using Referenced, we enable links between documents in an efficient and clear way,
which makes data management and calls to the database easier.

Cookies Collection:
The script generates 400 unique cookies by combining different types and tastes, creating a unique name for each cookie.
Each cookie document includes information such as name, price, category, and nutritional information.

Customers Collection:
The script generates 100 customer documents with mixed data modeling.
Customer documents include information like name, email, addresses (randomly generated), and preferences (randomly selected from a predefined list).

Orders Collection:
The script generates 200 orders with mixed data modeling.
Each order includes a customer ID, details of the ordered cookies (with random quantities), special instructions, and a promo code.
Helper functions are used to randomly select cookie IDs and customer IDs.

Data Modeling Approach:
Embedded data modeling is utilized for certain fields, such as ingredients for cookies, addresses for customers, and details of ordered cookies within an order document.
Referenced data modeling is used for relationships between different collections, like linking customer IDs in orders.
